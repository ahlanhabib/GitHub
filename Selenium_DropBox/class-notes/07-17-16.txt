Java is strongly typed language.
Java is case sensetive.

We need an entry pont for an application in java.
main method is the entry point of an application.

Java is all about class and object.
 what is class?
Class is a blueprint of an object.
 What is an Object?
Object is an instance of a class.



Variable:

There are two different types of variable in java.
1) primitive [int,char,boolean,float,double..]
2) reference [whiteHouse,office]








class:

[access specifer][class][class name] {

//class body start


}//close class body

access specife: public, private, protected

variable:
[access specifer][primitive type][variable name] = value;

method:

[access specifer][method type][method name](){

//method body start




}//method body end.

method return type: 
non-return type which is void
return type which is could be primitive or refernece type.

[access specifer][primitive/reference type][method name](){

//method body start

//variable declare here to retun;
  primitive/reference type

return variable;

}//method body end.

non-return type:

[access specifer][void][method name](){

//method body start




}//method body end.

constructor:
[access specifer][constructor name is same name as class name](){



}

Why main method is static?

What is constructor?
 the purpose of constructor is to initialize an object.

A class can have multiple constructor.




Java has automatic garbadge collector.
