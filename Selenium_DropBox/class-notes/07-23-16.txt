Object Oriented Programming: OOP

1) Abstraction
2) Encapsulation
3) Inheritance
4) Polymorphism

1) Abstraction:
Implementation hidding

Interface---->Abstract class------->Concrete class
Car---------->Motorcar------------->MotorEngineCar

What is the difference between Interface and Abstract class?


2) Encapsulation
   Data hidding

3) Inheritance
 Process of acquiring the properties of one class to another class.

  GrandFather()--------> Father()------------->Children()


4) Polymorphism

The ability of an object to take on many forms.
Two Kind of polymorphism:

Method Overloading---> it happens in compile time
Method Overriding----> it happens in run time.
